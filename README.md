# CNN-and-Vizsualization
Lets remove the blackbox involved in deep learning


Programming , oh !!!
That's really old now

Here we will see how computers can learn just like humans by giving them the examples. 
* Programming was writing as set of rules for computer in programming language and get work done
* Finding the exact rule was always a tough job as we need to manually check and dry run for all the test cases
* To solve this problem lets just start another approach to teach the computer , the one which humans follow (often called as experience)
* Instead of manually finding out the rules for all set of examples , we make a machine make rules from the examples given to them

Yepiee !!!!! Problem solved !!!!!

To solve this problem people came up with Neural Network (more on neural networks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk))

# CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK

Recently they have been a state of art in computer vision. These networks have given extra ordinary results in classifying hundred objects with an accuracy better then humans (Imagenet competition)
They are being implemented almost everywhere around you
- Right from Google's self driving car to Google Lens 
- Bidu's System ([check this out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs))
- Googles photos face detection
These are the one that are on top of my mind. There are many many other examples.


Many people have worked with CNN using [Keras](https://keras.io/) , [Tesnorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) , [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). Here we will start with visualization of of CNN and how it works.
I have trained the model using MNIST dataset (Hello World for programmers :P) and I have tried to provide output of various layers for understanding how this model is working. We will also see the filters that are applied to see how the filters affect trhe output
